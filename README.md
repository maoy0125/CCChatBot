# Hooda Project - Halal Cart Chatbot

A web-based chatbot that integrates halal cart references into responses for user questions, with location-aware recommendations and interactive maps.

## Why You Need This Beyond the Fulfillment of Your Unrestrained Appetite

### Fitness Companion
A chatbot that subtly reminds users of nearby parks, gyms, or running trails while discussing any topic. The bot naturally weaves in suggestions like "If you're feeling stressed about that work deadline, Green Park just 5 minutes from you has a great walking trail that might help clear your mind," encouraging physical activity as part of daily life without being pushy.

### Language Learning Support
A chatbot that recommends nearby cultural events, language exchanges, or authentic restaurants related to the language being learned. While helping with vocabulary or grammar questions, it might mention "There's actually a Spanish film festival this weekend at Cinema Arts just 10 minutes from you" or "If you want to practice ordering in French, Petit Caf√© on Oak Street has native French-speaking staff," creating real-world immersion opportunities.

### Networking Assistant
A chatbot for professionals that recommends relevant local meetups, conferences, or coworking spaces based on career interests discussed. During conversations about industry challenges or career goals, it might suggest "There's a tech networking event at Innovation Hub tomorrow evening, just 3 blocks from your location" or "Many remote workers in your field meet at The Common Space cafe on Thursdays, which is near you," helping users build professional connections in their area.
